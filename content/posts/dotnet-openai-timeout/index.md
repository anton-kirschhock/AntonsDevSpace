Ever had the issue that you hit the timeout of the OpenAI client and could not find any quick resolution?

Well, don't worry - Here you go!

```cs
// Used NuGet: Azure.AI.OpenAI@2.0.0
using OpenAI;
using OpenAI.Chat;
// ...
var config = sp.GetRequiredService<IOptions<AIConfiguration>>().Value;
var apiKey = config.ApiKey;
var client = new OpenAIClient(new(config.ApiKey), new OpenAIClientOptions
                {
                    NetworkTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(3) // Specify your timeout here
                });
```

That'll be it!
